Homework #2 for UR Bootcamp
This repository ("bootstrappy") is where I (Joe Bailey) develop my portfolio for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. The goal for this homework was to become more familiar with Bootstrap which allows for easier use of HTML and CSS syntax.

I was the main creator of this portfolio and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver.
